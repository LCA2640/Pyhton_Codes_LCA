#Python Exercise
#You are analyzing a data set and need to remove the outliers (the smallest and largest values;the data is stored in a list).
#Task: Complete the code to remove the smallest and largest elements from the list and output the sum of the remaining numbers.

data = [7, 5, 6.9, 1, 8, 42, 33, 128, 1024, 2, 
    8, 11, 0.4, 1024, 66, 809, 11, 8.9, 1.1, 3.42, 
    9, 100, 444, 78]

data.remove(min(data))
data.remove(max(data))

x=0

for i in data:
    x+=i

print(x)
